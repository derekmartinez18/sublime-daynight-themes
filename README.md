Sublime Text Day/Night Theme Changing
=======================

I got bored and made this to learn the Sublime API. Works with Windows, Linux, and OSX... hopefully. The idea of this is nobody likes being blinded in the middle of the night with some bright theme. This just makes it quicker to change between them. Yes I'm that lazy.

`ALT + SHIFT + N` will set the theme to the selected night theme.  
`ALT + SHIFT + D` will set the theme to the selected day theme.

Eventually when I continue being bored I'll setup the automatic time detection stuff which automates the changing.
